The file provider reads and writes one plaintext UTF-8 file per secret.

:::caution[Version compatibility]
The `file` provider is added in Monosecret 0.2.

## Quick start

Choose a directory, exclude it from version control, and route a declaration
to it:

```text title=".gitignore"
/.secrets/
```

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
local_files = "file:./.secrets"

[profiles.development]
API_TOKEN = { description = "Local API token", providers = ["local_files"] }
```

```bash
$ monosecret set API_TOKEN --profile development

$ monosecret get API_TOKEN --profile development

$ monosecret run --profile development -- npm start
```

The stored value is `.secrets/<project>/development/API_TOKEN`, where
`<project>` is `[project].name` from the manifest.

## Setup

The provider has no external dependency or credential. The Monosecret process
needs read access to the configured directory and write access for `set`,
generated values, imports, cache writes, and deletes.

Relative roots resolve from the directory containing `monosecret.toml`, not
from the shell's current directory. Every `file` provider URI must include a
root; the bare `file` provider name is rejected.

## Configuration

### URI format

```text
file:ROOT
```

`ROOT` is required and names the directory that contains the project/profile
tree. It can be relative, absolute, or home-relative. The URI accepts no query
options or user information.

### URI examples

```text
file:./.secrets            # .secrets beside monosecret.toml
file:///var/lib/app/secrets # Absolute directory
file:~/.local/share/myapp  # Home-relative directory
```

Use `file:./...` for relative paths containing spaces. Monosecret percent-
encodes the path when reporting the provider URI.

### Project configuration

Check in the provider alias, but never the directory's plaintext contents:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
local_files = "file:./.secrets"

[profiles.default]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Database connection string", providers = [
  "local_files",
] }
```

The alias is shared configuration. Each machine supplies its own directory
contents.

## Storage model

Convention addresses use this path beneath `ROOT`:

```text
{project}/{profile}/{key}
```

Project and profile are therefore isolated even when one user-global file
provider serves several projects. Each component must be one safe filename;
slashes, backslashes, `.` and `..` are rejected in convention components.

Values are read and written exactly as UTF-8 text. Leading and trailing
whitespace, newlines, CRLF line endings, and multiline content are preserved.
Binary files are rejected by the provider's text interface; use a Monosecret
0.2+ `encoding` when the stored file should contain a textual encoding of
binary data.

Writes use a temporary file in the destination directory and atomically
replace the entry after flushing it. On Unix, Monosecret creates new
directories with mode `0700` and new entry files with mode `0600`. Existing
directory permissions are not changed.

## Use existing files

A native `ref.item` is a relative path beneath `ROOT`. It replaces the entire
`{project}/{profile}/{key}` convention path:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
runtime_files = "file:///run/secrets"

[profiles.production]
DATABASE_PASSWORD = {
  description = "Database password mounted by the runtime",
  providers = ["runtime_files"],
  ref = { item = "database/password" }
}
```

This reads `/run/secrets/database/password`. `item` may contain nested relative
components, but absolute paths, empty components, `.`, `..`, backslashes, and
symbolic links inside the configured root are rejected. `field`, `vault`,
`section`, and `version` do not have file equivalents and are rejected.

Referenced files are writable when filesystem permissions allow it. Treat
runtime-managed mounts as read-only unless their owner explicitly permits
Monosecret to replace or delete entries.

## Extract from a document (0.19+)

:::caution[Version compatibility]
Structured `extract` is available starting in Monosecret 0.19.
INI extraction with `format = "ini"` is available starting in Monosecret 0.20.
:::

Several declarations can select values from one JSON file without making JSON
part of the provider itself:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
runtime_files = "file:///run/secrets"

[profiles.production]
# extract is available in Monosecret 0.2+
DATABASE_USER = {
  description = "Database user",
  providers = ["runtime_files"],
  ref = { item = "application.json" },
  extract = { format = "json", pointer = "/database/user" }
}
DATABASE_PASSWORD = {
  description = "Database password",
  providers = ["runtime_files"],
  ref = { item = "application.json" },
  extract = { format = "json", pointer = "/database/password" }
}
```

An INI file is selected the same way with `format = "ini"` (0.20+), where
`/key` reads an unsectioned key and `/section/key` reads a key in a named
section:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.production]
# format = "ini" requires Monosecret 0.20+
DATABASE_PASSWORD = {
  description = "Database password",
  providers = ["runtime_files"],
  ref = { item = "application.ini" },
  extract = { format = "ini", pointer = "/database/password" }
}
```

The file provider returns the complete UTF-8 document; Monosecret then applies
the pointer as a provider-independent stored-value transform. Extracted
declarations are read-only so `set`, `delete`, generation, prompting,
and import cannot overwrite or remove the containing file. See
[Structured Extraction](/reference/configuration/#structured-extraction-019)
for value rendering, error behavior, and composition with `encoding`.

## CI/CD and containers

Use a read-only mounted directory with explicit refs when the runtime already
publishes one file per secret. For example, mount the source at `/run/secrets`
and use `file:///run/secrets` as the provider alias. Monosecret reads only the
files declared by the active profile; it does not enumerate or inject every
file in the mount.

The ordinary convention is useful when Monosecret owns the directory. Give
each job a private root and let `{project}/{profile}/{key}` keep jobs and
environments separate.

## Security considerations

:::danger[Plaintext storage]
The file provider does not encrypt values. Keep its root out of version
control, backups, build artifacts, container layers, and shared directories.
Use an encrypted provider when the filesystem is not an acceptable trust
boundary.
:::

Monosecret rejects symbolic links within the configured store so an entry
cannot deliberately redirect reads or writes outside its root. It also rejects
lexical traversal through `ref.item`. The configured root itself remains the
operator's trust boundary: protect it with filesystem ownership and mount
permissions, and do not let untrusted processes modify it while Monosecret is
running.

Deleting an entry removes only its file. Empty project and profile directories
remain in place.
