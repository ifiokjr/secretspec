title: Bitwarden Password Manager Provider
description: Bitwarden Password Manager secrets management integration
---

The `bw` provider reads and writes secrets in Bitwarden Password Manager by
using the official `bw` CLI.

:::note[Version compatibility]
The Bitwarden Password Manager provider was added in Monosecret 0.18.

Monosecret 0.20+ isolates convention-managed items by project and profile. It
stores `DATABASE_URL` under an item title such as
`monosecret/my-project/default/DATABASE_URL`; releases through 0.19 used the
bare title `DATABASE_URL`. See [Migrating bare item names](#migrating-bare-item-names-020).

## Quick start

Sign in, unlock the vault, and export the session returned by `bw unlock`:

```bash
$ bw login

$ export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
```

Then write a secret and use it in a command:

```bash
$ monosecret set DATABASE_URL --provider bw://
Enter value for DATABASE_URL: postgresql://localhost/mydb
✓ Secret 'DATABASE_URL' saved to bw (profile: default)

$ monosecret run --provider bw:// -- npm start
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Bitwarden CLI (`bw`)
- Bitwarden account
- For self-hosted servers: the CLI pointed at your server with `bw config server` **before** logging in (see [Self-hosted servers](#self-hosted-servers))
- Signed in via `bw login` and unlocked with `bw unlock`
- `BW_SESSION` environment variable set

Build Monosecret with `--features bw` when the provider is not included by
your package.

### Authentication

The provider uses the active `bw` CLI session. Export the session key after
unlocking the vault:

```bash
$ export BW_SESSION="your-session-key"
```

Before reads and writes, Monosecret requires the CLI status to be unlocked. If
the CLI is signed out or the vault is locked, it reports combined guidance to
run `bw login` and `bw unlock`, then set `BW_SESSION`.

### Self-hosted servers

The `bw` CLI reads its server address from its own configuration file, written by
`bw config server`. It does not accept a server through an environment variable
or a per-command flag, and it refuses to change servers while a session is
active. Monosecret therefore cannot switch servers for you.

Configure the CLI once, before logging in:

```bash
$ bw logout                                    # if already logged in

$ bw config server https://vault.company.com

$ bw login

$ bw unlock

$ export BW_SESSION="session-key-from-unlock"
```

With the CLI configured, `?server=` records which server the project expects.
Monosecret compares it against the CLI's current setting before each operation
and fails with the commands above when they disagree, instead of silently
reading or writing secrets on the wrong server:

```toml
# monosecret.toml — documents the expected server for the whole team
[providers]
company_vault = "bw://?server=https://vault.company.com"
```

Omit `?server=` to accept whatever server the CLI is configured for.

## Configuration

### URI format

```
bw://[collection]
bw://[org@collection]
bw://?server=https://vault.company.com
bw://?type=login&field=password
bw://?folder=team/{project}/{profile} # 0.20+
```

- `collection`: Target collection, by name or by ID
- `org@collection`: Organization and collection, each by name or by ID
- `type`: Item type to require when matching an existing item and to use when
  creating a new one (`login`, `card`, `identity`, `sshkey`, or `securenote`)
- `field`: Built-in or custom field to read or write
- `folder` (0.20+): Convention item-title prefix. Supports `{project}` and
  `{profile}` and defaults to `monosecret/{project}/{profile}`. This is not a
  Bitwarden folder: Bitwarden folders are personal to each vault user and
  therefore cannot provide a shared project namespace.
- `server`: The self-hosted server this configuration expects. This does **not**
  configure the CLI — it is a guard that fails with remediation steps when the
  `bw` CLI is pointed somewhere else. See [Self-hosted servers](#self-hosted-servers).

### Organizations and collections (0.2+)

Names and IDs are interchangeable: Monosecret resolves a name to the ID the
`bw` CLI requires. Names match case-insensitively, and one containing a space
must be percent-encoded (`bw://Acme%20Inc@dev-secrets`).

The organization is a scope and an assertion rather than a filter. It selects
which `dev-secrets` you mean when several organizations have one, and it must
agree with the collection you named — addressing a collection that lives
somewhere else is an error rather than a silent search of the wrong place. A
collection identifies its own organization, so naming the organization is
optional whenever the collection name is unambiguous:

```bash
$ monosecret get DATABASE_URL --provider "bw://dev-secrets"
```

An address that cannot be resolved fails immediately and lists the
organizations or collections that do exist. If a collection was created or
shared with you recently, run `bw sync` so the CLI can see it.

### URI examples

```bash
# Password Manager - Personal vault
$ monosecret set API_KEY --provider bw://

# Password Manager - Organization collection
$ monosecret set DATABASE_URL --provider "bw://myorg@dev-secrets"

# Password Manager - Self-hosted instance (CLI must already be configured
# for this server; see Self-hosted servers below)
$ monosecret set TOKEN --provider "bw://?server=https://vault.company.com"

# Password Manager - Specific item type and field
$ monosecret get 'MyApp Database' --provider 'bw://?type=login&field=username'
```

### Project configuration

Define reusable aliases when a team uses a shared organization or collection:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
team_vault = "bw://myorg@dev-secrets"

[profiles.default.defaults]
providers = ["team_vault"]
```

Profiles can select different aliases or the provider directly:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.development.defaults]
providers = ["bw"]

[profiles.production.defaults]
providers = ["bw"]
```

### Discover declarations (0.2+)

Monosecret 0.2+ can initialize a manifest from the items visible through a
Bitwarden provider URI. Scope discovery to a collection, and optionally an
item type, so unrelated personal or organization-vault entries are not treated
as application secrets:

```bash
$ monosecret init --from 'bw://myorg@dev-secrets?type=login' # 0.2+
✓ Created monosecret.toml with 8 secrets
```

In Monosecret 0.20+, an item under the selected project/profile convention
prefix becomes a convention declaration: for example,
`monosecret/payments/production/API_KEY` becomes `API_KEY`. Items under another
project/profile prefix are skipped. A bare existing item such as `LEGACY_TOKEN`
is still discovered, but its declaration receives `ref = { item =
"LEGACY_TOKEN" }` so it remains directly addressable.

Discovered keys must contain only letters, numbers, and underscores, cannot
start with a number, and cannot be the reserved name `defaults`. Bitwarden
allows duplicate names and matches them case-insensitively; discovery stops
when two selected items map to colliding keys instead of generating an
ambiguous manifest. Rename an item or narrow discovery with `?type=`.

Discovery never writes secret values. In Monosecret 0.20+, `--project` and
`--profile` select the convention prefix used to recognize managed items; they
do not rename anything in Bitwarden. To migrate values after reviewing the
declarations, run the `monosecret import` command printed by `init`.

### Environment overrides

Environment variables take precedence over organization, collection, item type,
and default field values in the provider URI. A value left in the shell can
therefore change an operation even when `--provider` supplies those settings;
unset unwanted overrides before running Monosecret:

```bash
$ export BITWARDEN_DEFAULT_TYPE=login

$ export BITWARDEN_DEFAULT_FIELD=password

$ export BITWARDEN_ORGANIZATION=myorg

$ export BITWARDEN_COLLECTION=dev-secrets

$ monosecret get DATABASE_PASSWORD --provider bw://
```

Organization and collection values can be names or IDs and resolve in the same
way as values in the URI. The complete precedence is:

| Setting      | Highest to lowest precedence                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Organization | `BITWARDEN_ORGANIZATION`, provider URI                                         |
| Collection   | `BITWARDEN_COLLECTION`, provider URI                                           |
| Item type    | `BITWARDEN_DEFAULT_TYPE`, provider URI                                         |
| Field        | Secret `ref.field`, `BITWARDEN_DEFAULT_FIELD`, provider URI, item-type default |

## Storage model

### Convention item names (0.20+)

Monosecret-managed convention items use the title
`monosecret/{project}/{profile}/{key}` by default. Project and profile are part
of the title so the same collection or personal vault can safely hold
`DATABASE_URL` for several projects and environments. `?folder=` replaces the
`monosecret/{project}/{profile}` prefix, and the key is appended to it.

The prefix is an item-title namespace, not a Bitwarden `folderId`. Explicit
`ref.item` coordinates always name the complete existing item title and do not
receive the prefix.

The Bitwarden provider supports every Password Manager item type. When an item
type is selected through `BITWARDEN_DEFAULT_TYPE` or `?type=`, it filters reads
and updates to that type and selects the type of a newly created item. If
neither is set, reads and updates accept any matching type, while new items are
Logins.

### Item types

#### Login items

```bash
# Get password field (default)
$ monosecret get 'Database Login' --provider 'bw://?type=login'

# Get username field
$ monosecret get 'Database Login' --provider 'bw://?type=login&field=username'

# Get custom field
$ monosecret get 'API Service' --provider 'bw://?type=login&field=api_key'
```

#### Credit card items

```bash
# Get API key from custom field (field required)
$ monosecret get 'Stripe Payment' --provider 'bw://?type=card&field=api_key'

# Get card number
$ monosecret get 'Company Card' --provider 'bw://?type=card&field=number'
```

#### SSH key items

```bash
# Get private key (default)
$ monosecret get 'Deploy Key' --provider 'bw://?type=sshkey'

# Get passphrase
$ monosecret get 'Deploy Key' --provider 'bw://?type=sshkey&field=passphrase'
```

Bitwarden requires an SSH key item to carry all three of the private key,
public key and fingerprint — it rejects or discards an item that leaves any of
them empty. When `set` creates one, the two fields it is not writing are
therefore filled with `(not set by Monosecret)`. Replace them in Bitwarden if
you need the real values, or write them yourself with `?field=public_key` and
`?field=key_fingerprint`.

#### Identity items

```bash
# Get custom field (field required)
$ monosecret get 'Employee Record' --provider 'bw://?type=identity&field=employee_id'

# Get email field
$ monosecret get 'Personal Identity' --provider 'bw://?type=identity&field=email'
```

#### Secure note items

```bash
# Get value from secure note
$ monosecret get 'Legacy Config' --provider 'bw://?type=securenote&field=config_value'
```

### Default fields

When no field is named, each item type uses the default below. The same default
applies to reads and writes, so `monosecret set` followed by `monosecret get`
returns what was written.

| Item Type   | Default field        | Read also falls back to                 |
| ----------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Login       | `password`           | `username`, then a custom `value` field |
| Secure Note | custom `value` field | the note body                           |
| Card        | `number`             | a custom `value` field                  |
| Identity    | `email`              | `username`, then a custom `value` field |
| SSH Key     | `private_key`        | a custom `value` field                  |

The default depends only on the item type, never on the secret or item name.
The extra read fallbacks exist to make existing, hand-created vault items
resolve; writes always target the default field itself.

To address anything else, name the field explicitly with `?field=` or a `ref`
mapping:

```toml
[profiles.default]
STRIPE_KEY = { description = "Card custom field", ref = { item = "Stripe Test Card", field = "api_key" } }
DEPLOY_PUBKEY = { description = "SSH public key", ref = { item = "Deploy SSH Key", field = "public_key" } }
```

Built-in field names and aliases resolve only to that built-in field. Custom
field names first match in full, case-insensitively. If there is no exact match,
Monosecret uses the first custom field whose name contains the requested text,
also case-insensitively. Use the complete custom-field name to avoid an
unintended partial match. `field = "notes"` addresses a Secure Note's body.

### How items are matched (0.2+)

Resolved item titles are matched **in full, case-insensitively** — `test database` finds
`Test Database`, but `API_KEY` never matches `API_KEY_OLD`. The `bw` CLI itself
accepts a substring here, which works well interactively because it prints the
candidates and lets you choose; a name in `monosecret.toml` is resolved with
nobody watching, so a partial match would quietly read — or overwrite — a
neighbouring item.

Bitwarden does not require names to be unique. When more than one item matches,
Monosecret refuses the address and lists the colliding IDs rather than picking
one. Rename the items so the selected name is unique, or use `?type=` when the
collisions have different item types.

Adding `?type=` narrows the match to that item type, on both reads and writes.
That is how a Card and a Login of the same name stay separately addressable:

```bash
$ monosecret get API_KEY --provider "bw://?type=card"
```

## Use existing secrets

Use a `ref` for an existing Bitwarden item that does not use Monosecret's
project/profile title convention, when the Monosecret key differs from the
item title, or when a specific field is required:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.default]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Application database", ref = { item = "MyApp Database", field = "password" }, providers = [
  "bw",
] }
```

`ref.item` is matched against the Bitwarden item name, not its item ID.

### Migrating bare item names (0.20+)

Releases through 0.19 wrote convention secrets under their bare keys. Those
titles contain no project or profile ownership, so Monosecret cannot safely
guess which project should inherit one. Version 0.20 therefore does not fall
back to a bare item during convention reads or writes.

Rename a Monosecret-managed item from, for example, `DATABASE_URL` to
`monosecret/my-project/default/DATABASE_URL`. If an item is intentionally
shared or externally managed, keep its existing title and declare it explicitly:

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[profiles.default]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Shared database", ref = { item = "DATABASE_URL" }, providers = [
  "bw",
] }
```

`monosecret init --from bw://` in 0.20+ generates this native `ref` form for
bare existing items automatically.

## CI/CD

Provide an unlocked session to the job as `BW_SESSION`, then select the
provider as usual:

```bash
$ export BW_SESSION="session-key-from-unlock"

$ monosecret run --provider bw:// -- deploy
```

Treat the session key as a CI secret and avoid printing it in job logs.

## Security considerations

- `BW_SESSION` unlocks the vault for the lifetime of the session, and the
  session can access everything granted to the signed-in account. Keep the
  session key out of checked-in configuration and shell history.
- Scope provider URIs to the intended organization and collection when
  possible.
- For self-hosted installations, use `?server=` as a guard against operating
  on a differently configured vault.
- Ambiguous item names fail instead of selecting one silently; rename them or
  use `?type=` when the duplicates have different item types.

## Troubleshooting

### CLI installation

```
Bitwarden CLI (bw) is not installed.

To install it:
  - npm: npm install -g @bitwarden/cli
  - Homebrew: brew install bitwarden-cli
  - Download: https://bitwarden.com/help/cli/
```

### Server mismatch

When `?server=` names a different server than the one the `bw` CLI is configured
for, the operation stops before touching the vault and reports both addresses
alongside the `bw logout` / `bw config server` / `bw login` / `bw unlock`
sequence needed to correct it.
