title: Environment Variable Provider
description: Read-only access to environment variables
---

The [Environment Variable](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap08.html)
provider reads secrets directly from process environment variables. This is a
**read-only** provider designed for CI/CD compatibility and containerized
environments.

## Quick start

```bash
# Set environment variables
$ export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/mydb"

$ export API_KEY="sk-1234567890"

# Check secrets are available
$ monosecret check --provider env
✓ All required secrets are configured

# Run with environment variables
$ monosecret run --provider env -- npm start
```

## Configuration

The env provider accepts no configuration options:

```bash
# All these are equivalent
$ monosecret check --provider env

$ monosecret check --provider env:

$ monosecret check --provider env://
```

### Project configuration

```toml title="monosecret.toml"
[providers]
injected = "env"

[profiles.production]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Database URL", providers = ["injected"] }
```

## Storage model

Convention secrets read the environment variable with the same name. The
provider reads only the current process environment, never writes variables,
and does not persist values.

## Use existing secrets

A secret's
[`ref`](/reference/configuration/#secret-references) field reads a different
variable, which is useful when your infrastructure already exposes a value under
another name: `item` is the variable name, case-sensitive and preserved verbatim
(`field` is not supported). Like the rest of this provider, references are
read-only.

```toml
[profiles.default]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "DB", ref = { item = "POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING" }, providers = [
  "env",
] }
```

## CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Run with secrets
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
  run: |
    monosecret run --provider env -- npm run deploy
```

## When to use

- Running in CI/CD pipelines where secrets are injected as environment variables
- Testing with temporary environment variables
- Working with containerized applications that use environment variables
