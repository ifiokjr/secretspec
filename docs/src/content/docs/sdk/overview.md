title: SDK Overview
description: How the Monosecret language SDKs work
---

Monosecret includes SDK source for Rust, Dart, Python, Go, Ruby,
Node.js/TypeScript, Haskell, PHP, C# (0.2+), and Swift (0.2+). PHP, C#, and
Swift registry/binary publication is deferred; their package commands document
planned 0.2+ usage. They all resolve secrets from the same
declarative `monosecret.toml`, and they all behave identically, because they
share one resolver.

> **C# compatibility:** Planned for Monosecret 0.2+; package publication is deferred.

## One resolver, thin clients

Resolution (providers, fallback chains, profiles, generation, `as_path`
materialization) lives in a single Rust core. Each SDK is a thin client over
that core rather than a reimplementation:

- **Rust** uses the library directly, with a compile-time derive macro for
  strongly-typed access.
- **Dart** loads the C ABI through native assets and supports generated typed
  access with `monosecret_builder`.
- **Ruby** (a native C extension) statically links the `monosecret_ffi` C ABI
  at build time; **Go** (purego) loads it at runtime with no cgo. Both exchange
  a small JSON request/response with the core.
- **Haskell** links the same C ABI at build time via the GHC FFI.
- **C# (0.2+)** loads the same C ABI with P/Invoke from a runtime-specific
  native asset in the NuGet package.
- **Swift (0.2+)** imports the same C ABI as a Clang module from a macOS
  XCFramework and maps the shared JSON envelope to `Codable` value types.
- **Python** uses a [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/) native extension, and
  **Node.js/TypeScript** uses a [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/) native addon; both
  embed the same resolver directly and exchange the same JSON request/response
  shape as the C ABI.
- **PHP** prefers an [ext-php-rs](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs)
  extension that embeds the resolver (working under FPM with no `ffi.enable`),
  and falls back to loading the same C ABI at runtime through `ext-ffi`.
  Because resolution happens in one place, every provider, chain, profile, and
  generator works the same in every language, and a new provider added to the core
  is immediately available everywhere with no per-SDK change. A cross-language
  conformance suite asserts that all the SDKs reduce the same inputs to the same
  result.

## The runtime API

Each SDK mirrors the Rust derive crate's vocabulary: a builder that takes a
provider, profile, and an access reason, and a `load`/`resolve` that returns the
resolved secrets plus the provider and profile used. A missing required secret
is a typed error, distinct from a transport failure (which carries a stable
`kind`). Secrets exposed `as_path` come back as a readable file path.

```python
from monosecret import Monosecret

resolved = Monosecret.builder().with_provider("keyring://").with_reason("boot").load()
print(resolved.secrets["DATABASE_URL"].get)
```

See each language's page for the idiomatic spelling: [Rust](/sdk/rust),
[Dart](/sdk/dart), [Python](/sdk/python), [Go](/sdk/go), [Ruby](/sdk/ruby),
[Node.js](/sdk/nodejs), [Haskell](/sdk/haskell), [PHP](/sdk/php),
[C# (0.2+)](/sdk/csharp), and [Swift (0.2+)](/sdk/swift).

Every builder also takes a [scope (0.2+)](/concepts/scopes/),
resolving only a named subset of the profile and returning the selected name on
the result. The one exception is Rust's typed loader, which always resolves the
full profile because a generated struct has a field per declared secret; see
[Rust](/sdk/rust#scopes-017).

## Typed access

Beyond the Rust derive macro, typed accessors for the other languages are
generated from the manifest. `monosecret schema` emits a JSON Schema for the
secret shape; [quicktype](https://quicktype.io) turns it into an idiomatic type
and deserializer for any language, which you build from the SDK's `fields()`
map:

```bash
$ monosecret schema | quicktype -s schema --top-level Monosecret --lang <language>
```

This keeps the per-language surface tiny: the SDK only provides `fields()`, and
quicktype owns the type generation.

The schema models successful resolution: required, defaulted, and generated
secrets are non-nullable. A profile schema includes fields inherited from the
`default` profile and is exhaustive.

## Distribution

The resolver ships inside each package, so there is nothing extra to install and
no runtime library path to set:

- **Dart** downloads a checksummed native library through its build hook and
  bundles it as a code asset.
- **Python** builds the resolver into a pyo3 extension shipped as a `cp39-abi3`
  wheel, and **Ruby** statically links the `monosecret_ffi` archive into a
  native C extension in the gem.
- **Haskell** statically links the same archive at build time via the GHC FFI.
- **C# (0.2+)** ships the `cdylib` as runtime-specific native assets in one
  NuGet package and loads the matching asset through P/Invoke. The managed
  client supports trimming and NativeAOT; glibc/musl Linux, Intel/Arm macOS,
  and x64/Arm64 Windows assets are included.
- **Swift (0.2+)** ships Intel and Apple-silicon macOS cdylibs in one
  checksummed XCFramework binary target. SwiftPM selects and embeds the matching
  architecture.
- **Go** embeds the `cdylib` in the module and loads it at runtime via purego
  (no cgo); an opt-in `-tags static` build links it statically instead.
- **Node.js** builds the resolver into a napi-rs addon.
- **PHP** ships as a normal PHP extension (provisioned like `ext-redis`), with an
  `ext-ffi` fallback that dlopens the bundled `cdylib`.
  Because the resolver is linked or embedded directly, the SDKs do not depend on a
  separately installed `cdylib` or an `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`MONOSECRET_FFI_LIB`
  override at runtime — the one exception being PHP's optional `ext-ffi` fallback,
  where `MONOSECRET_FFI_LIB` can point at a specific library build.

## Platform support

Prebuilt packages cover the following platforms. Windows support for the
Python wheel, the Ruby gem, and the PHP extension binaries is added in
Monosecret 0.2.

Most Linux packages build against a manylinux_2_28 baseline (glibc 2.28 or
newer); the C# package additionally ships musl Linux assets. Hackage
distributes the Haskell SDK as source, so its row records the platforms CI
builds and tests. Contributors: the [SDK development](/development/sdks) page
documents how these artifacts are built and how to add a platform.
