title: Secret References
description: Point a secret at one already managed in a provider's store, by the store's own coordinates
---

:::note
Secret references are available since version 0.1.
:::

By default, Monosecret owns the naming: it stores each secret under its own
`{project}/{profile}/{key}` convention. A **secret reference** overrides that for
one secret, naming a secret that already exists in the store and is managed
outside Monosecret. Monosecret then reads (and writes) that existing secret in
place, instead of a convention path it controls.

You declare a reference with the `ref` field, a table of provider-independent
coordinates:

```toml
[profiles.production]
# The 1Password item "db", its "password" field
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Postgres DSN", ref = { item = "db", field = "password" }, providers = [
  "prod_vault",
] }

# An existing environment variable
GITHUB_TOKEN = { description = "GitHub token", ref = { item = "GITHUB_PAT" }, providers = [
  "env",
] }
```

## Coordinates address a secret from the outside in

A `ref` is not a store-specific address like `op://vault/item/field`. It is a set
of provider-independent coordinates, each naming a level of structure that some
stores have:

```
vault                which container holds the item        (1Password only)
└── item             the store's own name for the secret   (always required)
    └── section      a named group of fields               (1Password only)
        └── field    one component inside the item          (structured stores)
            └── version   which revision to read            (supported stores only)
```

Only `item` is universal, because every store names its secrets somehow. `item`
is the **complete** name, not a suffix: it replaces the entire convention path,
so nothing is prepended.

```toml
# Reads the .env key TOTALLY_DIFFERENT_NAME, not monosecret/myapp/default/DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL = { description = "DB", ref = { item = "TOTALLY_DIFFERENT_NAME" }, providers = [
  "dotenv",
] }
```

The other coordinates exist because some stores give a secret internal structure
(`field`, `section`), nest it inside a container (`vault`), or keep revisions
(`version`). A store that has no equivalent for a coordinate **rejects it with an
error naming the coordinate**, rather than silently reading the wrong secret. The
[configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#secret-references) documents
exactly how each provider maps the coordinates.

## References name, providers route

A `ref` supplies naming only. It does not pin the secret to a particular store.
Which provider actually resolves the coordinates follows the ordinary
[provider resolution order](/concepts/providers/fallback/): a `--provider` override, then
the secret's `providers` chain, then profile defaults, project
`[defaults].providers` in 0.21+, and the user-global default.

This is the difference from pasting a store URL into your config. Because the
store is not baked into the reference, the same `ref` works across providers.
Each provider in a fallback chain is asked for the same coordinates, and one that
cannot interpret them warns and the chain continues:

```toml
[profiles.production]
DATABASE_URL = { description = "Postgres DSN", ref = { item = "db", field = "password" }, providers = [
  "onepassword://Production",
  "keyring",
] }
```

It also means `--provider` redirects reference secrets exactly like convention
secrets, which makes test fixtures trivial: point every reference at a `.env`
file without touching the manifest.

```bash
$ monosecret run --provider dotenv:.env.fixtures -- cargo test
```

## Different coordinates per provider (0.2+)

:::caution[Version compatibility]
Provider-scoped `refs` and provider-alias `ref` templates are available
starting with Monosecret 0.2.
:::

The original `ref` remains useful when every provider understands one address.
When endpoints organize the same logical secret differently, attach a template
to each leaf alias and use `refs` only for exceptions:

```toml
[providers]
remote = { uri = "onepassword://Production", ref = { item = "{project}-{profile}", field = "{key}" } }
local = { uri = "dotenv://.env", ref = { item = "{key}" } }
legacy = "onepassword://Legacy"

[profiles.production]
API_KEY = { description = "API key", providers = [
  "remote",
  "local",
], refs = { legacy = { item = "old-api-item", field = "token" } } }
```

Monosecret resolves each endpoint independently: `refs.<selected-alias>` wins,
then that alias's template, then convention naming. This applies to primary and
fallback reads, writes, and both sides of `import`; the `legacy` ref above can
therefore describe an import source without adding it to the normal read route.
Templates support `{project}`, `{profile}`, and `{key}` in every coordinate.

Scoped refs deliberately key on aliases, not resolved URIs. Literal provider
URIs and bare provider names use convention naming because they have no alias
identity. Cached route aliases cannot own a template or scoped ref; configure
their individual leaf aliases instead. `refs` and legacy route-wide `ref` are
mutually exclusive.

For profile inheritance, `ref` and `refs` (0.2+) are two forms of one address
model. A profile that explicitly declares either form replaces the form
inherited from `[profiles.default]`: `refs` can replace an inherited `ref`, and
`ref` can replace inherited `refs`. A profile entry that declares neither keeps
the inherited form. See [Profiles: Switching reference models](/concepts/profiles/#switching-reference-models-019) for an example.

## How it works

- `item` is required; `field`, `vault`, `section`, and `version` are optional and
  only accepted by stores that have that structure.
- Reads and writes are symmetric: `monosecret set` and interactive `check` write
  through the coordinates in place wherever the store supports writes. Read-only
  stores fail with a clear error.
- `ref` and every provider-scoped `refs.<alias>` value are tables. String and
  URI forms (`ref = "op://vault/item/field"`) are rejected, with an error that
  spells out the equivalent table.
- Secrets sharing identical coordinates and store are fetched once, and
  [audit log](/concepts/audit/) events carry the coordinates.

See the [configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#secret-references) for
the full specification: the coordinate table, how every provider interprets each
coordinate, and the exact rules.

Azure App Configuration (0.20+) native `ref.item` values name one App
Configuration key and remain read-only. An App Configuration value can itself
be a canonical Azure Key Vault reference; Monosecret follows that stored URI,
including its optional Key Vault version. This is separate from Monosecret's
`ref.version` coordinate, which Azure Key Vault accepts directly starting in
0.20.
