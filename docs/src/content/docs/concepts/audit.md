title: Audit Logging
description: A local, append-only record of every secret access for after-the-fact review
---

monosecret records every secret access to a local audit log so you can review,
after the fact, **what** secret was accessed, **when**, by **whom**, with what
**reason, if supplied**, which software integration called Monosecret (0.20+),
and what the **outcome** was. Auditing is **on by default**.

Secret values are never written to the log. Only metadata is recorded, and any
credentials embedded in a provider URI are redacted.

## Where the log lives

By default the log is written to the per-user state directory, one entry per line
in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format:

| Platform | Default path                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Linux    | `~/.local/state/monosecret/audit.log` |
| macOS    | `~/.local/state/monosecret/audit.log` |

(monosecret follows the XDG state-directory convention on macOS too, matching
where it keeps its config, so the path is the same as on Linux. Set `[audit]
path` to override it.)

The file is created with owner-only permissions (`0600` on Unix), inside an
owner-only directory (`0700`). The first time
monosecret writes to it, it prints a one-time note telling you where the log is
and how to turn it off.

| `key`                 | The secret name for single-secret actions (`get`/`set`, and `delete` in 0.18+); never its value                                                                                                                                      |

| `command`             | For `run`, the executed program (argv[0] only — never its arguments, which may contain secrets)                                                                                                                                      |

|                       | A cached route writing its local entry is recorded as `cache_refresh`/`written`, never as `set`: no authoritative store was written. Dropping an entry — `cache clear`, or an entry a write superseded — is `cache_clear`/`deleted`. |
| `error_kind`          | A non-sensitive tag when `outcome` is `error`                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `reason`              | The reason supplied via `--reason` / `MONOSECRET_REASON` / the SDK, if any                                                                                                                                                           |
| `caller`              | Caller-asserted software integration context: `name`, and optional `version`, `operation`, and non-secret `resource` (Monosecret 0.20+)                                                                                              |
| `actor`               | The OS user, the detected coding agent (if any), and whether this is an agent session                                                                                                                                                |

This pairs naturally with the [`require_reason`](/reference/configuration/#requiring-a-reason-for-secret-access)
policy: when that policy applies, Monosecret requires the caller to state _why_
before proceeding and records the supplied reason alongside the access.

Caller context answers _what software_ requested access; `reason` answers _why
the user_ requested it. Caller context is informational, is not an authenticated
identity, and never satisfies `require_reason`. Integrations must not place a
credential or secret value in any caller field.

## Reading the log

The log is plain JSON Lines, so any tool works (`cat`, `tail -f`, `jq`). The
[`monosecret audit`](/reference/cli/#audit) command reads it for you with filters
and a readable summary:

```bash
# Last 20 entries, formatted
$ monosecret audit -n 20

# Only `run` events for one project
$ monosecret audit --project my-app --action run

# Raw JSON Lines, piped to jq
$ monosecret audit --json | jq 'select(.outcome == "missing")'
```

## Size cap

The log is a single file capped at **1 MiB** by default. When it reaches the cap
it is truncated and started fresh, so disk usage stays bounded without any log
rotation to manage. This makes the log a size-bounded recent record rather than a
complete, permanent history — it is not intended to satisfy long-term compliance
retention on its own. Forward it to a central system if you need that.

## Reliability

Auditing never blocks secret access. If the log cannot be written (for example, a
read-only filesystem), monosecret prints a `warning:` to stderr and continues —
your `get`, `set`, and `run` still work.

## Configuration

Auditing is a per-machine concern, so it is configured in your **user-global
config** (`~/.config/monosecret/config.toml`) under the top-level `[audit]` table —
not in the project's `monosecret.toml`. This means a repository you clone cannot
turn off or redirect your audit log. See the
[configuration reference](/reference/configuration/#audit-logging) for all options.
To turn it off:

```toml title="~/.config/monosecret/config.toml"
[audit]
enabled = false
```
