"""``Resolved.close()`` must attempt every ``as_path`` file.

The method exists so secret-bearing temp files do not outlive the result.
Stopping at the first file the OS refuses to remove leaves every later secret
on disk — the exact outcome it is meant to prevent — and the caller has no way
to know which ones survived.

The Go SDK (``firstErr``) and the .NET SDK (``firstError``) already clean up
everything and report the first failure afterwards; .NET catches ``IOException``
specifically, which is the ordinary Windows sharing violation raised when
another process still holds the file open. These tests hold the Python SDK to
the same contract.
