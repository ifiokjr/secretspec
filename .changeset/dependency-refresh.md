# Refresh cargo, pnpm, dart, and devenv dependencies

`cargo update`, `pnpm update --latest` (vitest 4 → 5, tsdown 0.22 → 0.23,
oxfmt 0.63 → 0.66, oxlint 1.78 → 1.81), `dart pub upgrade`, and
`devenv update` (devenv CLI, git-hooks.nix, custom nixpkgs inputs).

`keepass` is pinned to `=0.13.17`: the 0.13.25 release depends on a
cipher/cbc combination that `aes` 0.8 does not implement, which broke the
kdbx provider's build.
