### Breaking

#### Move the Dart builder package entrypoint

Expose the builder factory from `package:monosecret_builder/monosecret_builder.dart`, update `build.yaml` to use that package-named library, and remove the previous `package:monosecret_builder/builder.dart` entrypoint. Consumers importing the builder directly should update to the new package-named library.

### Breaking

- Add a secret-value-free manifest command for SDK code generation, introduce a build_runner-based Dart typed SDK generator, reorganize source by ecosystem into `crates/`, `npm/`, and `dart/`, and wire Rust, Dart, and npm coverage reports with package-level Codecov flags.
