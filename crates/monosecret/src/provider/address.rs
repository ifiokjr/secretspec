/// Every read and write names its secret one of two ways:
///
/// - [`Convention`](Address::Convention): Monosecret's own naming scheme. The
///   provider maps `(project, profile, key)` into its namespace, by default
///   `{provider}/{project}/{profile}/{key}` or the provider's configured
///   format string.
/// - [`Native`](Address::Native): explicit coordinates from a secret's `ref`
///   field, naming one externally managed secret in the provider's own terms
///   (item, field, ...). The provider translates the coordinates and rejects
///   any it has no equivalent for.
///
/// Which stores are consulted is decided entirely by provider resolution
/// (chains, overrides, defaults); the address only supplies the name to look
/// up in one selected endpoint. Monosecret may derive a different address for
/// another provider alias in the same logical route.
