//! Append-only audit logging for secret access.
//!
//! Every secret operation that reaches a provider is recorded as one JSON object
//! per line (JSON Lines). A policy-denied attempt (the `require_reason` gate) is
//! recorded too, so a blocked access still leaves a trace. Auditing is **on by
//! default**; it is configured via the `[audit]` table in the user-global config
//! (see [`crate::config::AuditConfig`]) and written to a single file capped at a
//! fixed size (1 MiB by default). At the cap the file is truncated in place and
//! restarted with whole-line granularity, so the log is a size-bounded record,
//! not a complete history, and never contains a partially written line.
//!
//! Two invariants hold throughout:
//!
//! - **Secret values are never logged.** Only metadata (key name, provider,
//!   outcome, reason, actor) is recorded. Credentials embedded in provider URIs
//!   are redacted via [`redact_uri`].
//! - **Auditing never blocks secret access.** Every failure path (bad path,
//!   write error, serialization error) emits a single `warning:` to stderr and
//!   returns, so a logging problem can never break `get`/`set`/`run`.
//!
//! The log assumes a single writer at a time. Several monosecret processes
//! writing the same log file concurrently may, around the size-cap rotation,
//! interleave or lose entries, because rotation is not synchronized across
//! processes. Operators who need strong guarantees should give each concurrent
//! context its own `[audit] path`.
