//! The resolution plan: a pure, I/O-free description of *what to do* for every
//! secret in a profile, computed once up front and then executed.
//!
//! Resolution used to interleave deciding (profile merge, alias resolution,
//! grouping, address derivation) with doing (spawning fetches, walking fallback
//! chains, applying defaults, generating). This module isolates the deciding
//! half: [`Secrets::build_plan`] turns the manifest plus provider-alias maps
//! into an immutable [`ResolutionPlan`] without touching any provider, so the
//! decisions are unit-testable on their own and the executor consumes a plan
//! instead of re-deriving per-secret facts across `get`, `set`, and batch
//! validation.
//!
//! Building a plan performs no store I/O. Provider-spec resolution is a map
//! lookup plus provider configuration parsing; cached routes also reconstruct
//! canonical provider URIs so equivalent spellings cannot disguise a cache as
//! its own authoritative store. A plan never reads or writes a secret.
