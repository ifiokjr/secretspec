//! Selecting one value out of an INI document.

//! An INI pointer is an RFC 6901 pointer restricted to the two depths an INI
//! document can address: `/key` for an unsectioned key and `/section/key` for a
//! key in a named section. The grammar, the message that states it, and the
//! lookup that depends on it live together here, so a pointer accepted at
//! config time is exactly one that resolution can follow.

/// The one description of the accepted pointer shape, used to reject every
/// other shape at config time.
