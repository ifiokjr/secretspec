# Resolved#close must attempt every as_path file.
#
# The method exists so secret-bearing temp files do not outlive the result.
# Stopping at the first file the OS refuses to remove leaves every later secret
# on disk -- the exact outcome it is meant to prevent -- and the caller has no
# way to know which ones survived.
#
# The Go SDK (firstErr) and the .NET SDK (firstError) already clean up
# everything and report the first failure afterwards; .NET catches IOException
# specifically, which is the ordinary Windows sharing violation raised when
# another process still holds the file open. These tests hold the Ruby SDK to
# the same contract.
